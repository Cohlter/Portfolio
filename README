Some things that inspired my design choice was just the fact that I wanted to make the website
look really cool different, yet also professional and not over the top. Especially the feature
where once you hover over the picture of the website it shows you the download and view removing
the text that was previously there.

There were quite a few challenges that I faced. First was that the beginning where I had my face
and the about me section just looked so weird. But once I added the navigation, that helped me
to see that I could have the fade to black and it made the beginning of the website really
eye catching. Which just shows that when you get to a stopping point, just continue working in
other areas and what you might be looking for may come.

The most important thing I took away was how to make good looking websites that can adapt to screens
and just look really nice with fading gradients and great organization and layout in html.

If I must be honest, this might be the project that I am most proud. I believe this is the best 
looking product I have ever made. But the JS products such as the music_database and the
pokemon_search are also up there because the code to make things do those cool things are just awesome.
