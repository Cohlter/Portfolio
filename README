Some things that inspired my design choice was just the fact that I wanted to make the website
look really cool and different, yet also professional and not over the top. The part that I was
really excited to start working on when the idea came to my head was the feature where once you
hover over the picture and name of the website it shows you the download and view links removing
the text that was previously there.

There were quite a few challenges that I faced. The first problem I had was when I was working on
the about me section with my face. In the beginning it just looked so weird and out of place. But
once I added the navigation menu, that then made the thought go into my brain of having the picture
fade at the top and bottom of my face to the black of the navigation menu and my bio. It made the
beginning of the website really eye catching. Which just shows that if you ever get to a design or
code problem, just continue working in other areas and what you might be looking for may come.

The most important thing I took away was how to make good looking websites that can adapt to screens
and just look really nice with fading gradients and great organization and layout in html. I also
learned awesome features in java_script like pulling data from APIs and how to filter objects/data.

If I must be honest, this might be the project that I am most proud. I believe this is the best 
looking product I have ever made. But the JS products such as the music_database and the
pokemon_search are also up there because the code is so intriguing and it is the actual intricate
functionality of how many websites and other things work.
