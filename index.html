    <h2 class="rye">Bio</h2>
        <p>I am Cohl Dickerson and was born on December 2nd, 2008. My top three hobbies are calisthenics, golf and looksmaxxing in no specific order as they switch periodically. I am a mixed race between European and African with a little bit of Native American. Some things that I have accomplished are winning for school the Marion County Soccer Tournament. Now for the three of my hobbies. My best in golf on 9 holes is 45 and on 18 holes it is 92. My best in calisthenics is 65 lbs for 9 reps doing dips, 50 lbs for 8 reps doing pullups, and a muscle up. I've only started looksmaxxing recently, but my acne has gone away a bit and have learned alot about true health.</p>
    
    <h2 class="rye">Tools/Skills</h2>
        <p>Things that I used to dabble in is basketball, soccer, and 3D Modeling, and a lot in coding. While it has diminished, I still have the experience in certain things such as Godot and GitHub. I can enjoy many things, which the average person would have me say 'I am very disciplined', which is a good trait to have. I also at times can completely lock in on work, like a procastinator, but I instead could do it on the second day its assigned instead of the last day. </p>
